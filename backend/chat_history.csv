question,context,answer
what is the ruling on zakat on 401k?,"[ 886.54 –  892.54]  are simply like a house that you have, you pay zakat on the dividends and not on the actual
[ 892.54 –  894.84]  amount. And short term investments,
[ 894.84 –  899.08]  you will treat them as business property, so you will give 2.5%
[ 899.08 –  902.03]  of that. As for four zero one k plans,
[ 902.12 –  929.80]  then this is something that I have done actually quite a lot of research in this one area because I was bombarded with questions. And I am now confident to say that inshaAllahu ta'ala, what seems to be the correct position, there is no zakat on 401 K, if you don't have unfettered access to it. I e, if there is a penalty for you to access your four 0 one K, then you don't technically have access to it. So it's not your full milk. It's not your full Milk in Arabic means ownership.

---

[ 485.79 –  489.52]  the fatwa is that you will give zakat on the amount
[ 489.69 –  491.20]  that is cashable
[ 491.28 –  493.44]  after penalties and taxes.
[ 493.69 –  497.44]  Okay? If you were to access that four zero one k,
[ 497.93 –  504.81]  whatever the penalty is, get rid of it. Whatever you would get taxed, get rid of it. Then that final amount, 2.5%
[ 504.81 –  510.57]  of that theoretical amount. Let me give you a simple example. Suppose your four zero one k had 200,000,
[ 510.73 –  513.37]  in it, and you have a 20%,
[ 513.69 –  520.05]  penalty if you were to cash it out. So if you have a 20% penalty that makes it to 160,000.
[ 520.21 –  523.10]  Suppose your tax bracket is roughly 25%.
[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000
[ 524.62 –  526.70]  then goes to $120,000.
[ 526.86 –  529.59]  Okay? Now you calculate 2.5
[ 529.59 –  531.03]  of that $120,000
[ 531.03 –  533.27]  and that works out to $3,000.
[ 533.75 –  534.71]  $3,000.
[ 534.71 –  538.95]  That's ma'chu. That's reasonable. If your four zero one k is 300,000,
[ 539.11 –  540.23]  then $3,000
[ 540.23 –  542.98]  is Or sorry, 200,000, then $3,000

---

[1054.94 – 1056.14]  which is when you retire.
[1056.31 – 1058.14]  Right? Because they are in
[1058.68 – 1081.65]  the Hukum of long term, not the Hukum of short term. The ruling will be the long term. So four zero one k's, you do not pay zakat on until you get the actual cash. When will you get the cash? When you are 65, 71, you basically cash out your four zero one k, then you will give zakat on it. Until that time, it's really not And the reason they say this, it's not your full property. You don't have what's called You
[1082.29 – 1086.61]  don't have control. Other people, your company, others, there's liabilities.
[1086.69 – 1089.23]  You can't have a full say in it. So
[1089.47 – 1098.51]  bottom line, the strongest position four zero one k, InshaAllah ta'ala, there is no zakat until you actually cash out on it. Okay. So what is left then? What is left
[1098.91 – 1103.38]  is the things that you own and you use in your bank account. By unanimous
[1103.38 – 1104.34]  consensus,
[1104.58 – 1110.65]  the wealth that is not cash but you use it, for example, your house, your cars, your clothes,
[1110.89 – 1111.86]  your shoes,","The ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan is that there is no zakat due until you have actual access to the funds. If you face penalties for accessing your 401(k), it means you do not have full ownership of it, and thus, zakat is not applicable. 

When you do eventually cash out your 401(k), you should calculate zakat based on the amount you would receive after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 but incurs a 20% penalty and a 25% tax, you would calculate zakat on the remaining amount after these deductions. Until you reach that point, zakat is not required. 

In summary, zakat on a 401(k) is not due until you actually cash out the funds.

</chat_history>","[   0.56 –    4.56]  Today's Q and A is actually going to be a rather lengthy
[   5.04 –    7.28]  answer, it's gonna be only one question.
[   7.44 –   11.52]  And it is with regards to zakat on 401s,
[  11.52 –   29.02]  zakat on retirement funds. This is a question that I have been asked by many dozens of people and I've actually given previous lectures about this. So today, InshaAllah, we're gonna go into a little bit of detail about whether zakat should be given and how much should be given and how do we calculate zakat on retirement funds.
[  54.51 –   64.83]  Before we begin, I need to point out that this is a topic dealing with Islamic finance. And as I have said many, many times, modern Islamic finance is actually a very
[  65.63 –   71.58]  new field, it's a very interesting field. It is a field that has a lot of diversity and a lot of different opinions.
[  71.83 –   72.31]  And
[  72.70 –   80.86]  I do not claim to be an expert on Islamic finance, far from it. I follow those that are senior to me. So in today's lecture, I will be quoting

---

[ 202.78 –  205.82]  if you wanna have a good marriage, you had better pay zakat.
[ 205.82 –  206.54]  So
[ 207.02 –  223.03]  fiqh is one thing, and love is another. Okay? The two are not gonna mix here. I give you fiqh, but to save your marriage, you should give zakat on your wife's gold. Okay? Bismillah. Next question. Bismillah is in the back. Both the strings. Go ahead. Okay. So once you set the tone, all the questions will be on zakat now. Okay?
[ 225.40 –  230.20]  Long term zakat. The question is long term zakat. Oh, I'm sorry. Long term investments.
[ 230.20 –  231.72]  Long term investments. Right?
[ 232.04 –  235.72]  Long term investments that you just are not monitoring day by day,
[ 236.12 –  243.22]  the fatwa from AMJA and the Fiqh Council is both the same in this regard. And that is that you consider
[ 243.22 –  250.17]  long term mutual funds and investments that you are not monitoring day by day to be zakatibul,
[ 250.17 –  260.89]  but not the full amount. Why? For reasons that are complicated, the simple equation that many modern Islamic finance experts give is that because mutual funds and stocks
[ 261.37 –  262.73]  are varied,

---

[3024.34 – 3027.46]  Give what you can, but write down and record
[3027.46 – 3034.10]  and it will be a debt owed to Allah when you cash out. And so when you cash out a million dollars,
[3034.50 – 3042.43]  okay, now you deserve to give 8,000 that was due for that twenty twenty year and then you can add whatever is left. So you pay what you can
[3042.66 – 3059.64]  of that amount and whatever you cannot pay, you just make a note of it and you keep on adding it until you actually do cash out. And then when you do cash out from that MashaAllah large pool, and again, this only gonna apply when you have a massive amount. We already discussed the average $4.00 1 k, $100,150,000
[3059.64 – 3065.16]  across North America. And that we just calculated for you, you know, 1,800 is a $1,900
[3065.16 – 3070.14]  roughly, it could be less than this depending on the penalty and the taxes and that's fairly reasonable.
[3070.21 – 3072.78]  And you don't have to pay in one go. You can,
[3073.41 – 3080.21]  you know, take it out over a few months. So for example, when Ramadan comes, you calculate, let's say that your four zero one k has 2,500","{

[ 542.98 –  551.86]  is reasonable amount for you to give. Now, one of the discussions in our fiqh council was what if somebody is at the end of retirement, he has 300,000
[ 552.17 –  562.77]  200,000, excuse me. But he doesn't have 3,000 of his check to give. What does he do then? So the fatwa then is the following. It's very simple. 3,000 is a debt owed to Allah.
[ 563.41 –  566.69]  And Allah will forgive that debt until you can pay it.
[ 567.25 –  573.89]  So if you can pay 1,000 of that 3,000, you pay it now, and you write down on a piece of paper 2,000 for 2019.
[ 573.98 –  575.82]  Next year, another 2,000.

[2846.57 – 2866.47]  Giving zakat will bring about peace and will bring about blessings and will bring about Allah's barakah. There's no question that the opinion will be more blessed and your wealth will grow because our Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam gave a qasam, he swore by Allah that giving zakat does not diminish one's charity.
[2866.55 – 2875.09]  So the conclusion that I have is that the default, because the default is that retirement plans in America are optional and voluntary,
[2875.64 – 2883.32]  and you are choosing to get in, unlike in many Middle Eastern countries, because there's clear ownership, milkiyah, you clearly have milkiyah.
[2883.32 – 2891.63]  And because this is clearly a type of wealth that is meant to to generate more income, this is a point I didn't get into, it's called Al Malan Nami, which is that wealth
[2891.63 – 2905.69]  generating, it's not just stagnant wealth, you are generating money from it. And so when you're generating money, therefore zakat should be paid annually on the zakat liable amount, which is after taxes and penalty. And to taxes and penalty. And to give one example here, so,

[ 886.54 –  892.54]  are simply like a house that you have, you pay zakat on the dividends and not on the actual
[ 892.54 –  894.84]  amount. And short term investments,
[ 894.84 –  899.08]  you will treat them as business property, so you will give 2.5%
[ 899.08 –  902.03]  of that. As for four zero one k plans,
[ 902.12 –  929.80]  then this is something that I have done actually quite a lot of research in this one area because I was bombarded with questions. And I am now confident to say that inshaAllahu ta'ala, what seems to be the correct position, there is no zakat on 401 K, if you don't have unfettered access to it.

what is the ruling on zakat on 401k?,"[ 886.54 –  892.54]  are simply like a house that you have, you pay zakat on the dividends and not on the actual
[ 892.54 –  894.84]  amount. And short term investments,
[ 894.84 –  899.08]  you will treat them as business property, so you will give 2.5%
[ 899.08 –  902.03]  of that. As for four zero one k plans,
[ 902.12 –  929.80]  then this is something that I have done actually quite a lot of research in this one area because I was bombarded with questions. And I am now confident to say that inshaAllahu ta'ala, what seems to be the correct position, there is no zakat on 401 K, if you don't have unfettered access to it. I e, if there is a penalty for you to access your four 0 one K, then you don't technically have access to it. So it's not your full milk. It's not your full Milk in Arabic means ownership.

---

[ 485.79 –  489.52]  the fatwa is that you will give zakat on the amount
[ 489.69 –  491.20]  that is cashable
[ 491.28 –  493.44]  after penalties and taxes.
[ 493.69 –  497.44]  Okay? If you were to access that four zero one k,
[ 497.93 –  504.81]  whatever the penalty is, get rid of it. Whatever you would get taxed, get rid of it. Then that final amount, 2.5%
[ 504.81 –  510.57]  of that theoretical amount. Let me give you a simple example. Suppose your four zero one k had 200,000,
[ 510.73 –  513.37]  in it, and you have a 20%,
[ 513.69 –  520.05]  penalty if you were to cash it out. So if you have a 20% penalty that makes it to 160,000.
[ 520.21 –  523.10]  Suppose your tax bracket is roughly 25%.
[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000
[ 524.62 –  526.70]  then goes to $120,000.
[ 526.86 –  529.59]  Okay? Now you calculate 2.5
[ 529.59 –  531.03]  of that $120,000
[ 531.03 –  533.27]  and that works out to $3,000.
[ 533.75 –  534.71]  $3,000.
[ 534.71 –  538.95]  That's ma'chu. That's reasonable. If your four zero one k is 300,000,
[ 539.11 –  540.23]  then $3,000
[ 540.23 –  542.98]  is Or sorry, 200,000, then $3,000

---

[1054.94 – 1056.14]  which is when you retire.
[1056.31 – 1058.14]  Right? Because they are in
[1058.68 – 1081.65]  the Hukum of long term, not the Hukum of short term. The ruling will be the long term. So four zero one k's, you do not pay zakat on until you get the actual cash. When will you get the cash? When you are 65, 71, you basically cash out your four zero one k, then you will give zakat on it. Until that time, it's really not And the reason they say this, it's not your full property. You don't have what's called You
[1082.29 – 1086.61]  don't have control. Other people, your company, others, there's liabilities.
[1086.69 – 1089.23]  You can't have a full say in it. So
[1089.47 – 1098.51]  bottom line, the strongest position four zero one k, InshaAllah ta'ala, there is no zakat until you actually cash out on it. Okay. So what is left then? What is left
[1098.91 – 1103.38]  is the things that you own and you use in your bank account. By unanimous
[1103.38 – 1104.34]  consensus,
[1104.58 – 1110.65]  the wealth that is not cash but you use it, for example, your house, your cars, your clothes,
[1110.89 – 1111.86]  your shoes,","The ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan is that you do not pay zakat on it until you have actual access to the funds. If there are penalties for accessing your 401(k), it means you do not fully own it, and thus zakat is not applicable. 

When you eventually cash out your 401(k), you should calculate zakat based on the amount you would receive after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 but incurs a 20% penalty and a 25% tax, you would calculate zakat on the remaining amount after these deductions. This means you would pay 2.5% on the final amount you receive after penalties and taxes [1][2].

In summary, zakat on a 401(k) is not due until you actually cash out the funds, and you should only calculate it based on the amount you can access after penalties and taxes are accounted for [1][2].

[   7.44 –   11.52]  And it is with regards to zakat on 401s,

[ 894.84 –  899.08]  you will treat them as business property, so you will give 2.5%
[ 899.08 –  902.03]  of that. As for four zero one k plans,
[ 902.12 –  929.80]  then this is something that I have done actually quite a lot of research in this one area because I was bombarded with questions. And I am now confident to say that inshaAllahu ta'ala, what seems to be the correct position, there is no zakat on 401 K, if you don't have unfettered access to it.

<source id=""2"">[ 485.79 –  489.52]  the fatwa is that you will give zakat on the amount

[ 504.81 –  510.57]  of that theoretical amount. Let me give you a simple example. Suppose your four zero one k had 200,000,
[ 510.73 –  513.37]  in it, and you have a 20%,
[ 513.69 –  520.05]  penalty if you were to cash it out. So if you have a 20% penalty that makes it to 160,000.
[ 520.21 –  523.10]  Suppose your tax bracket is roughly 25%.
[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000
[ 524.62 –  526.70]  then goes to $120,000.

When will you get the cash? When you are 65, 71, you basically cash out your four zero one k, then you will give zakat on it. Until that time, it's really not And the reason they say this, it's not your full property. You don't have what's called You

Therefore, zakat is not due until you cash out the 401(k) plan.

However, if you do access it and want to calculate zakat, you would take the cashable amount after deducting any penalties and taxes, and then calculate 2.5% of that amount.

[   5.04 –    7.28]  answer, it's gonna be only one question.
[   7.44 –   11.52]  And it is with regards to zakat on 401s,
[  11.52 –   29.02]  zakat on retirement funds. This is a question that I have been asked by many dozens of people and I've actually given previous lectures about this. So today, InshaAllah, we're gonna go into a little bit of detail about whether zakat should be given and how much should be given and how do we calculate zakat on retirement funds.
[  54.51 –   64.83]  Before we begin, I need to point out that this is a topic dealing with Islamic finance. And as I have said many, many times, modern Islamic finance is actually a very
[  65.63 –   71.58]  new field, it's a very interesting field. It is a field that has a lot of diversity and a lot of different opinions.
[  71.83 –   72.31]  And
[  72.70 –   80.86]  I do not claim to be an expert on Islamic finance, far from it. I follow those that are senior to me. So in today's lecture, I will be quoting</source>

<source id=""2"">[3024.34 – 3027.46]  Give what you can, but write down and record
[3027.46 – 3034.10]  and it will be a debt owed to Allah when you cash out. And so when you cash out a million dollars,
[3034.50 – 3042.43]  okay, now you deserve to give 8,000 that was due for that twenty twenty year and then you can add whatever is left. So you pay what you can
[3042.66 – 3059.64]  of that amount and whatever you cannot pay, you just make a note of it and you keep on adding it until you actually do cash out. And then when you do cash out from that MashaAllah large pool, and again, this only gonna apply when you have a massive amount. We already discussed the average $4.00 1 k, $100,150,000
[3059.64 – 3065.16]  across North America. And that we just calculated for you, you know, 1,800 is a $1,900
[3065.16 – 3070.14]  roughly, it could be less than this depending on the penalty and the taxes and that's fairly reasonable.
[3070.21 – 3072.78]  And you don't have to pay in one go. You can,
[3073.41 – 3080.21]  you know, take it out over a few months. So for example, when Ramadan comes, you calculate, let's say that your four zero one k has 2,500</source>

[ 542.98 –  551.86]  is reasonable amount for you to give. Now, one of the discussions in our fiqh council was what if somebody is at the end of retirement, he has 300,000
[ 552.17 –  562.77]  200,000, excuse me. But he doesn't have 3,000 of his check to give. What does he do then? So the fatwa then is the following. It's very simple. 3,000 is a debt owed to Allah.
[ 563.41 –  566.69]  And Allah will forgive that debt until you can pay it.
[ 567.25 –  573.89]  So if you can pay 1,000 of that 3,000, you pay it now, and you write down on a piece of paper 2,000 for 2019.
[ 573.98 –  575.82]  Next year, another 2,000.
[ 575.82 –  580.05]  Next year, another. When you finally cash out your 250,000,
[ 580.21 –  585.27]  if you actually add it up, your debt owed was gonna be maybe $7.08, 9,000 in zakat.
[ 585.43 –  590.71]  And so you will pay it when you cash out. But it is a debt owed to Allah and
[ 590.71 –  598.69]  Allah will not ask you to forcibly cash out your $4.00 1 k if you cannot afford to pay. So very simple. You pay what you can

[ 504.81 –  510.57]  of that theoretical amount. Let me give you a simple example. Suppose your four zero one k had 200,000,

[ 520.21 –  523.10]  Suppose your tax bracket is roughly 25%.
[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000

","The ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan is that you do not pay zakat on it until you have actual access to the cash. If there are penalties for accessing your 401(k), it means you do not have unfettered access to it, and thus it is not considered your full ownership (milk). 

However, if you were to cash out your 401(k), you would calculate zakat based on the amount you would receive after deducting any penalties and taxes.

Until that time, it's really not And the reason they say this, it's not your full property. You don't have what's called You
[1082.29 – 1086.61]  don't have control. Other people, your company, others, there's liabilities.
[1086.69 – 1089.23]  You can't have a full say in it. So
[1089.47 – 1098.51]  bottom line, the strongest position four zero one k, InshaAllah ta'ala, there is no zakat until you actually cash out on it. Okay. So what is left then? What is left
[1098.91 – 1103.38]  is the things that you own and you use in your bank account. By unanimous
[1103.38 – 1104.34]  consensus,
[1104.58 – 1110.65]  the wealth that is not cash but you use it, for example, your house, your cars, your clothes,
[1110.89 – 1111.86]  your shoes,","According to Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi, the ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan is that you do not pay zakat on it until you have actual access to the cash. If there are penalties for accessing the funds, then you do not have full ownership of that amount, and thus, zakat is not applicable. 

When you do access the 401(k) funds, you should calculate zakat based on the cashable amount after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 with a 20% penalty, you would calculate zakat on the amount after penalties and taxes, which would be $120,000 in this case, resulting in a zakat of $3,000 (2.5% of $120,000).

In summary, zakat on a 401(k) is not due until you cash out the funds. Allah and His Messenger know best.

</chat_history>","[   0.56 –    4.56]  Today's Q and A is actually going to be a rather lengthy
[   5.04 –    7.28]  answer, it's gonna be only one question.
[   7.44 –   11.52]  And it is with regards to zakat on 401s,
[  11.52 –   29.02]  zakat on retirement funds. This is a question that I have been asked by many dozens of people and I've actually given previous lectures about this. So today, InshaAllah, we're gonna go into a little bit of detail about whether zakat should be given and how much should be given and how do we calculate zakat on retirement funds.
[  54.51 –   64.83]  Before we begin, I need to point out that this is a topic dealing with Islamic finance. And as I have said many, many times, modern Islamic finance is actually a very
[  65.63 –   71.58]  new field, it's a very interesting field. It is a field that has a lot of diversity and a lot of different opinions.
[  71.83 –   72.31]  And
[  72.70 –   80.86]  I do not claim to be an expert on Islamic finance, far from it. I follow those that are senior to me. So in today's lecture, I will be quoting

---

[3024.34 – 3027.46]  Give what you can, but write down and record
[3027.46 – 3034.10]  and it will be a debt owed to Allah when you cash out. And so when you cash out a million dollars,
[3034.50 – 3042.43]  okay, now you deserve to give 8,000 that was due for that twenty twenty year and then you can add whatever is left. So you pay what you can
[3042.66 – 3059.64]  of that amount and whatever you cannot pay, you just make a note of it and you keep on adding it until you actually do cash out. And then when you do cash out from that MashaAllah large pool, and again, this only gonna apply when you have a massive amount. We already discussed the average $4.00 1 k, $100,150,000
[3059.64 – 3065.16]  across North America. And that we just calculated for you, you know, 1,800 is a $1,900
[3065.16 – 3070.14]  roughly, it could be less than this depending on the penalty and the taxes and that's fairly reasonable.
[3070.21 – 3072.78]  And you don't have to pay in one go. You can,
[3073.41 – 3080.21]  you know, take it out over a few months. So for example, when Ramadan comes, you calculate, let's say that your four zero one k has 2,500

---

[ 485.79 –  489.52]  the fatwa is that you will give zakat on the amount
[ 489.69 –  491.20]  that is cashable
[ 491.28 –  493.44]  after penalties and taxes.
[ 493.69 –  497.44]  Okay? If you were to access that four zero one k,
[ 497.93 –  504.81]  whatever the penalty is, get rid of it. Whatever you would get taxed, get rid of it. Then that final amount, 2.5%
[ 504.81 –  510.57]  of that theoretical amount. Let me give you a simple example. Suppose your four zero one k had 200,000,
[ 510.73 –  513.37]  in it, and you have a 20%,
[ 513.69 –  520.05]  penalty if you were to cash it out. So if you have a 20% penalty that makes it to 160,000.
[ 520.21 –  523.10]  Suppose your tax bracket is roughly 25%.
[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000
[ 524.62 –  526.70]  then goes to $120,000.
[ 526.86 –  529.59]  Okay? Now you calculate 2.5
[ 529.59 –  531.03]  of that $120,000
[ 531.03 –  533.27]  and that works out to $3,000.
[ 533.75 –  534.71]  $3,000.
[ 534.71 –  538.95]  That's ma'chu. That's reasonable. If your four zero one k is 300,000,
[ 539.11 –  540.23]  then $3,000
[ 540.23 –  542.98]  is Or sorry, 200,000, then $3,000","{

[ 552.17 –  562.77]  200,000, excuse me. But he doesn't have 3,000 of his check to give. What does he do then? So the fatwa then is the following. It's very simple. 3,000 is a debt owed to Allah.

[ 567.25 –  573.89]  So if you can pay 1,000 of that 3,000, you pay it now, and you write down on a piece of paper 2,000 for 2019.

[2846.57 – 2866.47]  Giving zakat will bring about peace and will bring about blessings and will bring about Allah's barakah. There's no question that the opinion will be more blessed and your wealth will grow because our Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam gave a qasam, he swore by Allah that giving zakat does not diminish one's charity.
[2866.55 – 2875.09]  So the conclusion that I have is that the default, because the default is that retirement plans in America are optional and voluntary,
[2875.64 – 2883.32]  and you are choosing to get in, unlike in many Middle Eastern countries, because there's clear ownership, milkiyah, you clearly have milkiyah.
[2883.32 – 2891.63]  And because this is clearly a type of wealth that is meant to to generate more income, this is a point I didn't get into, it's called Al Malan Nami, which is that wealth
[2891.63 – 2905.69]  generating, it's not just stagnant wealth, you are generating money from it. And so when you're generating money, therefore zakat should be paid annually on the zakat liable amount, which is after taxes and penalty. And to taxes and penalty. And to give one example here, so,

[ 202.78 –  205.82]  if you wanna have a good marriage, you had better pay zakat.

[ 207.02 –  223.03]  fiqh is one thing, and love is another. Okay? The two are not gonna mix here. I give you fiqh, but to save your marriage, you should give zakat on your wife's gold. Okay? Bismillah. Next question. Bismillah is in the back. Both the strings. Go ahead. Okay. So once you set the tone, all the questions will be on zakat now. Okay?
[ 225.40 –  230.20]  Long term zakat. The question is long term zakat. Oh, I'm sorry. Long term investments.
[ 230.20 –  231.72]  Long term investments. Right?

[ 236.12 –  243.22]  the fatwa from AMJA and the Fiqh Council is both the same in this regard. And that is that you consider
[ 243.22 –  250.17]  long term mutual funds and investments that you are not monitoring day by day to be zakatibul,
[ 250.17 –  260.89]  but not the full amount. Why? For reasons that are complicated, the simple equation that many modern Islamic finance experts give is that because mutual funds and stocks

[ 894.84 –  899.08]  you will treat them as business property, so you will give 2.5%

And I am now confident to say that inshaAllahu ta'ala, what seems to be the correct position, there is no zakat on 401 K, if you don't have unfettered access to it. I e, if there is a penalty for you to access your four 0 one K, then you don't technically have access to it. So it's not your full milk. It's not your full Milk in Arabic means ownership.

[ 124.98 –  130.91]  based in North America or in America in particular, that zakat is due on the amount,
[ 131.22 –  138.59]  not of the paper amount, but rather the amount that you can withdraw after taxes and after penalties.

---

[   0.56 –    4.56]  Today's Q and A is actually going to be a rather lengthy
[   5.04 –    7.28]  answer, it's gonna be only one question.
[   7.44 –   11.52]  And it is with regards to zakat on 401s,
[  11.52 –   29.02]  zakat on retirement funds. This is a question that I have been asked by many dozens of people and I've actually given previous lectures about this. So today, InshaAllah, we're gonna go into a little bit of detail about whether zakat should be given and how much should be given and how do we calculate zakat on retirement funds.
[  54.51 –   64.83]  Before we begin, I need to point out that this is a topic dealing with Islamic finance. And as I have said many, many times, modern Islamic finance is actually a very
[  65.63 –   71.58]  new field, it's a very interesting field. It is a field that has a lot of diversity and a lot of different opinions.
[  71.83 –   72.31]  And
[  72.70 –   80.86]  I do not claim to be an expert on Islamic finance, far from it. I follow those that are senior to me. So in today's lecture, I will be quoting","Based on Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi's discussion, the ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan is that there is no zakat due if you do not have unfettered access to the funds. If accessing the 401(k) incurs penalties, then it is not considered your full ownership (milk). However, if you can withdraw the amount after taxes and penalties, zakat is due on that amount. This position aligns with the views of the Fiqh Council of North America and other respected scholars.

what is the ruling on zakat on 401k?,"[ 886.54 –  892.54]  are simply like a house that you have, you pay zakat on the dividends and not on the actual
[ 892.54 –  894.84]  amount. And short term investments,
[ 894.84 –  899.08]  you will treat them as business property, so you will give 2.5%
[ 899.08 –  902.03]  of that. As for four zero one k plans,
[ 902.12 –  929.80]  then this is something that I have done actually quite a lot of research in this one area because I was bombarded with questions. And I am now confident to say that inshaAllahu ta'ala, what seems to be the correct position, there is no zakat on 401 K, if you don't have unfettered access to it. I e, if there is a penalty for you to access your four 0 one K, then you don't technically have access to it. So it's not your full milk. It's not your full Milk in Arabic means ownership.

---

[ 485.79 –  489.52]  the fatwa is that you will give zakat on the amount
[ 489.69 –  491.20]  that is cashable
[ 491.28 –  493.44]  after penalties and taxes.
[ 493.69 –  497.44]  Okay? If you were to access that four zero one k,
[ 497.93 –  504.81]  whatever the penalty is, get rid of it. Whatever you would get taxed, get rid of it. Then that final amount, 2.5%
[ 504.81 –  510.57]  of that theoretical amount. Let me give you a simple example. Suppose your four zero one k had 200,000,
[ 510.73 –  513.37]  in it, and you have a 20%,
[ 513.69 –  520.05]  penalty if you were to cash it out. So if you have a 20% penalty that makes it to 160,000.
[ 520.21 –  523.10]  Suppose your tax bracket is roughly 25%.
[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000
[ 524.62 –  526.70]  then goes to $120,000.
[ 526.86 –  529.59]  Okay? Now you calculate 2.5
[ 529.59 –  531.03]  of that $120,000
[ 531.03 –  533.27]  and that works out to $3,000.
[ 533.75 –  534.71]  $3,000.
[ 534.71 –  538.95]  That's ma'chu. That's reasonable. If your four zero one k is 300,000,
[ 539.11 –  540.23]  then $3,000
[ 540.23 –  542.98]  is Or sorry, 200,000, then $3,000

---

[1054.94 – 1056.14]  which is when you retire.
[1056.31 – 1058.14]  Right? Because they are in
[1058.68 – 1081.65]  the Hukum of long term, not the Hukum of short term. The ruling will be the long term. So four zero one k's, you do not pay zakat on until you get the actual cash. When will you get the cash? When you are 65, 71, you basically cash out your four zero one k, then you will give zakat on it. Until that time, it's really not And the reason they say this, it's not your full property. You don't have what's called You
[1082.29 – 1086.61]  don't have control. Other people, your company, others, there's liabilities.
[1086.69 – 1089.23]  You can't have a full say in it. So
[1089.47 – 1098.51]  bottom line, the strongest position four zero one k, InshaAllah ta'ala, there is no zakat until you actually cash out on it. Okay. So what is left then? What is left
[1098.91 – 1103.38]  is the things that you own and you use in your bank account. By unanimous
[1103.38 – 1104.34]  consensus,
[1104.58 – 1110.65]  the wealth that is not cash but you use it, for example, your house, your cars, your clothes,
[1110.89 – 1111.86]  your shoes,","According to Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi, there is no zakat on a 401(k) plan if you do not have unfettered access to it, meaning if there are penalties for accessing the funds. Zakat is only due on the amount that you could cash out after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has a balance of $200,000 with a 20% penalty, you would calculate zakat on the amount remaining after penalties and taxes. Essentially, zakat is not required until you actually cash out the 401(k), typically at retirement age. Until then, it is not considered your full ownership. 

In summary, zakat is due only when you have access to the cash, and until then, there is no obligation.

[ 540.23 –  542.98]  is Or sorry, 200,000, then $3,000
[ 542.98 –  551.86]  is reasonable amount for you to give. Now, one of the discussions in our fiqh council was what if somebody is at the end of retirement, he has 300,000
[ 552.17 –  562.77]  200,000, excuse me. But he doesn't have 3,000 of his check to give. What does he do then? So the fatwa then is the following. It's very simple. 3,000 is a debt owed to Allah.
[ 563.41 –  566.69]  And Allah will forgive that debt until you can pay it.
[ 567.25 –  573.89]  So if you can pay 1,000 of that 3,000, you pay it now, and you write down on a piece of paper 2,000 for 2019.
[ 573.98 –  575.82]  Next year, another 2,000.
[ 575.82 –  580.05]  Next year, another. When you finally cash out your 250,000,
[ 580.21 –  585.27]  if you actually add it up, your debt owed was gonna be maybe $7.08, 9,000 in zakat.
[ 585.43 –  590.71]  And so you will pay it when you cash out. But it is a debt owed to Allah and
[ 590.71 –  598.69]  Allah will not ask you to forcibly cash out your $4.00 1 k if you cannot afford to pay. So very simple. You pay what you can
[ 599.25 –  600.93]  of that 2.5%

---

[ 886.54 –  892.54]  are simply like a house that you have, you pay zakat on the dividends and not on the actual
[ 892.54 –  894.84]  amount. And short term investments,
[ 894.84 –  899.08]  you will treat them as business property, so you will give 2.5%

[3024.34 – 3027.46]  Give what you can, but write down and record
[3027.46 – 3034.10]  and it will be a debt owed to Allah when you cash out. And so when you cash out a million dollars,
[3034.50 – 3042.43]  okay, now you deserve to give 8,000 that was due for that twenty twenty year and then you can add whatever is left. So you pay what you can
[3042.66 – 3059.64]  of that amount and whatever you cannot pay, you just make a note of it and you keep on adding it until you actually do cash out. And then when you do cash out from that MashaAllah large pool, and again, this only gonna apply when you have a massive amount. We already discussed the average $4.00 1 k, $100,150,000
[3059.64 – 3065.16]  across North America. And that we just calculated for you, you know, 1,800 is a $1,900
[3065.16 – 3070.14]  roughly, it could be less than this depending on the penalty and the taxes and that's fairly reasonable.
[3070.21 – 3072.78]  And you don't have to pay in one go. You can,
[3073.41 – 3080.21]  you know, take it out over a few months. So for example, when Ramadan comes, you calculate, let's say that your four zero one k has 2,500","{ ""title"": ""💰 Zakat on 401(k) Plans"" }

[2846.57 – 2866.47]  Giving zakat will bring about peace and will bring about blessings and will bring about Allah's barakah. There's no question that the opinion will be more blessed and your wealth will grow because our Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam gave a qasam, he swore by Allah that giving zakat does not diminish one's charity.
[2866.55 – 2875.09]  So the conclusion that I have is that the default, because the default is that retirement plans in America are optional and voluntary,

[2891.63 – 2905.69]  generating, it's not just stagnant wealth, you are generating money from it. And so when you're generating money, therefore zakat should be paid annually on the zakat liable amount, which is after taxes and penalty. And to taxes and penalty. And to give one example here, so,

[ 485.79 –  489.52]  the fatwa is that you will give zakat on the amount

[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000

USER: what is the ruling on zakat on 401k?
ASSISTANT: According to Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi, there is no zakat on a 401(k) plan if you do not have unfettered access to it, meaning if there are penalties for accessing the funds. Zakat is only due on the amount that you could cash out after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has a balance of $200,000 with a 20% penalty, you would calculate zakat on the amount remaining after penalties and taxes. Essentially, zakat is not required until you actually cash out the 401(k), typically at retirement age. Until then, it is not considered your full ownership. 

In summary, zakat is due only when you have access to the cash, and until then, there is no obligation.

USER: what is the ruling on zakat on 401k?
ASSISTANT: The ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan, according to Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi, is that there is no zakat due on it until you have actual access to the funds. If you face penalties for accessing your 401(k), then you do not have full ownership of it, and therefore, zakat is not applicable. 

When you do access the funds, you should calculate zakat based on the amount you can cash out after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 with a 20% penalty and you are in a 25% tax bracket, you would first deduct the penalty, leaving you with $160,000, and then deduct taxes to arrive at $120,000. You would then pay 2.5% zakat on that final amount.

In summary, zakat is not required on a 401(k) until you cash it out, at which point you calculate it based on the accessible amount after penalties and taxes.

</chat_history>","[   0.56 –    4.56]  Today's Q and A is actually going to be a rather lengthy
[   5.04 –    7.28]  answer, it's gonna be only one question.
[   7.44 –   11.52]  And it is with regards to zakat on 401s,
[  11.52 –   29.02]  zakat on retirement funds. This is a question that I have been asked by many dozens of people and I've actually given previous lectures about this. So today, InshaAllah, we're gonna go into a little bit of detail about whether zakat should be given and how much should be given and how do we calculate zakat on retirement funds.
[  54.51 –   64.83]  Before we begin, I need to point out that this is a topic dealing with Islamic finance. And as I have said many, many times, modern Islamic finance is actually a very
[  65.63 –   71.58]  new field, it's a very interesting field. It is a field that has a lot of diversity and a lot of different opinions.
[  71.83 –   72.31]  And
[  72.70 –   80.86]  I do not claim to be an expert on Islamic finance, far from it. I follow those that are senior to me. So in today's lecture, I will be quoting

---

[ 886.54 –  892.54]  are simply like a house that you have, you pay zakat on the dividends and not on the actual
[ 892.54 –  894.84]  amount. And short term investments,
[ 894.84 –  899.08]  you will treat them as business property, so you will give 2.5%
[ 899.08 –  902.03]  of that. As for four zero one k plans,

---

[2846.57 – 2866.47]  Giving zakat will bring about peace and will bring about blessings and will bring about Allah's barakah. There's no question that the opinion will be more blessed and your wealth will grow because our Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam gave a qasam, he swore by Allah that giving zakat does not diminish one's charity.
[2866.55 – 2875.09]  So the conclusion that I have is that the default, because the default is that retirement plans in America are optional and voluntary,
[2875.64 – 2883.32]  and you are choosing to get in, unlike in many Middle Eastern countries, because there's clear ownership, milkiyah, you clearly have milkiyah.
[2883.32 – 2891.63]  And because this is clearly a type of wealth that is meant to to generate more income, this is a point I didn't get into, it's called Al Malan Nami, which is that wealth
[2891.63 – 2905.69]  generating, it's not just stagnant wealth, you are generating money from it. And so when you're generating money, therefore zakat should be paid annually on the zakat liable amount, which is after taxes and penalty. And to taxes and penalty.

[1058.68 – 1081.65]  the Hukum of long term, not the Hukum of short term. The ruling will be the long term. So four zero one k's, you do not pay zakat on until you get the actual cash.

You should realize that there is a spectrum of opinion and we will be going into those opinions.
[  99.25 –  124.50]  Now for those of you that do not want to listen to the entire lecture, it's gonna be too long for you, the quick and short answer is that the position that I will be advocating, which is the position that is the Fiqh Council of North America and also the position of our teacher, Sheikh Salah Hasawi, the founder of AMJEA and a number of other senior scholars of this land, is that four zero one ks and all retirement funds that are basically
[ 124.98 –  130.91]  based in North America or in America in particular, that zakat is due on the amount,
[ 131.22 –  138.59]  not of the paper amount, but rather the amount that you can withdraw after taxes and after penalties.","The ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan, according to Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi, is that there is no zakat due on it until you have actual access to the funds. If accessing your 401(k) incurs penalties, then you do not have full ownership of it, and thus zakat is not applicable.

When you eventually cash out the funds, you should calculate zakat based on the amount you can withdraw after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 with a 20% penalty and you are in a 25% tax bracket, you would deduct the penalty, leaving you with $160,000, and then deduct taxes to arrive at $120,000.

[ 520.21 –  523.10]  Suppose your tax bracket is roughly 25%.
[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000
[ 524.62 –  526.70]  then goes to $120,000.
[ 526.86 –  529.59]  Okay? Now you calculate 2.5
[ 529.59 –  531.03]  of that $120,000
[ 531.03 –  533.27]  and that works out to $3,000.

Once you reach the age where you can cash out the 401(k) without penalties, you will then calculate zakat based on the amount you can access after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 with a 20% penalty and you are in a 25% tax bracket, you would first deduct the penalty, leaving you with $160,000, and then deduct taxes to arrive at $120,000. You would then pay 2.5% zakat on that final amount, which would be $3,000 in this case.

In summary, zakat on a 401(k) is not required until you cash it out, and the calculation is based on the accessible amount after penalties and taxes.

USER: what is the ruling on zakat on 401k?
ASSISTANT: The ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan, according to Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi, is that there is no zakat due on it until you have actual access to the funds. If you face penalties for accessing your 401(k), then you do not have full ownership of it, and therefore, zakat is not applicable. 

When you do access the funds, you should calculate zakat based on the amount you can cash out after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 with a 20% penalty and you are in a 25% tax bracket, you would first deduct the penalty, leaving you with $160,000, and then deduct taxes to arrive at $120,000. You would then pay 2.5% zakat on that final amount.

In summary, zakat is not required on a 401(k) until you cash it out, at which point you calculate it based on the accessible amount after penalties and taxes.

[   7.44 –   11.52]  And it is with regards to zakat on 401s,
[  11.52 –   29.02]  zakat on retirement funds. This is a question that I have been asked by many dozens of people and I've actually given previous lectures about this. So today, InshaAllah, we're gonna go into a little bit of detail about whether zakat should be given and how much should be given and how do we calculate zakat on retirement funds.
[  54.51 –   64.83]  Before we begin, I need to point out that this is a topic dealing with Islamic finance. And as I have said many, many times, modern Islamic finance is actually a very
[  65.63 –   71.58]  new field, it's a very interesting field. It is a field that has a lot of diversity and a lot of different opinions.
[  71.83 –   72.31]  And

[ 899.08 –  902.03]  of that. As for four zero one k plans,
[ 902.12 –  929.80]  then this is something that I have done actually quite a lot of research in this one area because I was bombarded with questions. And I am now confident to say that inshaAllahu ta'ala, what seems to be the correct position, there is no zakat on 401 K, if you don't have unfettered access to it.

[1056.31 – 1058.14]  Right? Because they are in
[1058.68 – 1081.65]  the Hukum of long term, not the Hukum of short term. The ruling will be the long term. So four zero one k's, you do not pay zakat on until you get the actual cash. When will you get the cash? When you are 65, 71, you basically cash out your four zero one k, then you will give zakat on it. Until that time, it's really not And the reason they say this, it's not your full property. You don't have what's called You

[3034.50 – 3042.43]  okay, now you deserve to give 8,000 that was due for that twenty twenty year and then you can add whatever is left. So you pay what you can

USER: what is the ruling on zakat on 401k?
ASSISTANT: According to Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi, there is no zakat on a 401(k) plan as long as you do not have unfettered access to it, meaning if there are penalties for accessing the funds. Since you do not have full ownership or control over the 401(k) until you cash it out, zakat is not due until you actually receive the cash, typically upon retirement.

However, if you were to access the 401(k) and incur penalties and taxes, you would calculate zakat based on the amount you would receive after accounting for those penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has a balance of $200,000 with a 20% penalty and a 25% tax, you would calculate zakat on the final amount after these deductions.

In summary, zakat is not due on a 401(k) until you cash out, and if you do access it, you should calculate it based on the net amount after penalties and taxes.

[2846.57 – 2866.47]  Giving zakat will bring about peace and will bring about blessings and will bring about Allah's barakah. There's no question that the opinion will be more blessed and your wealth will grow because our Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam gave a qasam, he swore by Allah that giving zakat does not diminish one's charity.
[2866.55 – 2875.09]  So the conclusion that I have is that the default, because the default is that retirement plans in America are optional and voluntary,
[2875.64 – 2883.32]  and you are choosing to get in, unlike in many Middle Eastern countries, because there's clear ownership, milkiyah, you clearly have milkiyah.
[2883.32 – 2891.63]  And because this is clearly a type of wealth that is meant to to generate more income, this is a point I didn't get into, it's called Al Malan Nami, which is that wealth
[2891.63 – 2905.69]  generating, it's not just stagnant wealth, you are generating money from it. And so when you're generating money, therefore zakat should be paid annually on the zakat liable amount, which is after taxes and penalty. And to taxes and penalty.

[ 485.79 –  489.52]  the fatwa is that you will give zakat on the amount
[ 489.69 –  491.20]  that is cashable
[ 491.28 –  493.44]  after penalties and taxes.
[ 493.69 –  497.44]  Okay? If you were to access that four zero one k,
[ 497.93 –  504.81]  whatever the penalty is, get rid of it. Whatever you would get taxed, get rid of it. Then that final amount, 2.5%
[ 504.81 –  510.57]  of that theoretical amount. Let me give you a simple example. Suppose your four zero one k had 200,000,
[ 510.73 –  513.37]  in it, and you have a 20%,
[ 513.69 –  520.05]  penalty if you were to cash it out. So if you have a 20% penalty that makes it to 160,000.
[ 520.21 –  523.10]  Suppose your tax bracket is roughly 25%.
[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000
[ 524.62 –  526.70]  then goes to $120,000.
[ 526.86 –  529.59]  Okay? Now you calculate 2.5
[ 529.59 –  531.03]  of that $120,000
[ 531.03 –  533.27]  and that works out to $3,000.
[ 533.75 –  534.71]  $3,000.
[ 534.71 –  538.95]  That's ma'chu. That's reasonable. If your four zero one k is 300,000,
[ 539.11 –  540.23]  then $3,000
[ 540.23 –  542.98]  is Or sorry, 200,000, then $3,000

[1054.94 – 1056.14]  which is when you retire.
[1056.31 – 1058.14]  Right? Because they are in
[1058.68 – 1081.65]  the Hukum of long term, not the Hukum of short term. The ruling will be the long term. So four zero one k's, you do not pay zakat on until you get the actual cash. When will you get the cash? When you are 65, 71, you basically cash out your four zero one k, then you will give zakat on it. Until that time, it's really not And the reason they say this, it's not your full property. You don't have what's called You
[1082.29 – 1086.61]  don't have control. Other people, your company, others, there's liabilities.
[1086.69 – 1089.23]  You can't have a full say in it. So
[1089.47 – 1098.51]  bottom line, the strongest position four zero one k, InshaAllah ta'ala, there is no zakat until you actually cash out on it. Okay. So what is left then? What is left
[1098.91 – 1103.38]  is the things that you own and you use in your bank account. By unanimous
[1103.38 – 1104.34]  consensus,
[1104.58 – 1110.65]  the wealth that is not cash but you use it, for example, your house, your cars, your clothes,
[1110.89 – 1111.86]  your shoes,","According to Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi, the ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan is that you do not pay zakat on it until you have actual access to the cash. If there are penalties for accessing the funds, then you do not have full ownership of that amount. 

When you do access the 401(k), you should calculate zakat based on the amount you would receive after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 with a 20% penalty, you would consider the amount after the penalty, which would be $160,000, and then further reduce it by your tax bracket to find the final amount on which to calculate zakat (2.5%).

[3042.66 – 3059.64]  of that amount and whatever you cannot pay, you just make a note of it and you keep on adding it until you actually do cash out. And then when you do cash out from that MashaAllah large pool, and again, this only gonna apply when you have a massive amount. We already discussed the average $4.00 1 k, $100,150,000
[3059.64 – 3065.16]  across North America. And that we just calculated for you, you know, 1,800 is a $1,900
[3065.16 – 3070.14]  roughly, it could be less than this depending on the penalty and the taxes and that's fairly reasonable.
[3070.21 – 3072.78]  And you don't have to pay in one go. You can,
[3073.41 – 3080.21]  you know, take it out over a few months. So for example, when Ramadan comes, you calculate, let's say that your four zero one k has 2,500

USER: what is the ruling on zakat on 401k?
ASSISTANT: According to Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi, the ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan is that you do not pay zakat on it until you have actual access to the cash. If there are penalties for accessing the funds, then you do not have full ownership of that amount. 

When you do access the 401(k), you should calculate zakat based on the amount you would receive after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 with a 20% penalty, you would consider the amount after the penalty, which would be $160,000, and then further reduce it by your tax bracket to find the final amount on which to calculate zakat (2.5%).

In summary, zakat is not due on a 401(k) until you actually cash it out. Until then, it is not considered your full property.

[2846.57 – 2866.47]  Giving zakat will bring about peace and will bring about blessings and will bring about Allah's barakah. There's no question that the opinion will be more blessed and your wealth will grow because our Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam gave a qasam, he swore by Allah that giving zakat does not diminish one's charity.
[2866.55 – 2875.09]  So the conclusion that I have is that the default, because the default is that retirement plans in America are optional and voluntary,
[2875.64 – 2883.32]  and you are choosing to get in, unlike in many Middle Eastern countries, because there's clear ownership, milkiyah, you clearly have milkiyah.
[2883.32 – 2891.63]  And because this is clearly a type of wealth that is meant to to generate more income, this is a point I didn't get into, it's called Al Malan Nami, which is that wealth
[2891.63 – 2905.69]  generating, it's not just stagnant wealth, you are generating money from it. And so when you're generating money, therefore zakat should be paid annually on the zakat liable amount, which is after taxes and penalty. And to taxes and penalty. And to give one example here, so,

[1676.13 – 1686.63]  And as of yet, Fiqh Council, however, you should be aware the Filth Council is debating this issue, and I don't know where it's gonna head. As of yet, even the Filth Council, both of them have said life insurance is not allowed. However,
[1687.43 – 1698.44]  doctor Ma'am al Khula is an expert, and he is saying that it is permissible with these conditions. And this goes to show you this ambiguity and diversity exists. Two more questions, we'll call it a day, inshaAllah.

[ 485.79 –  489.52]  the fatwa is that you will give zakat on the amount
[ 489.69 –  491.20]  that is cashable
[ 491.28 –  493.44]  after penalties and taxes.
[ 493.69 –  497.44]  Okay? If you were to access that four zero one k,
[ 497.93 –  504.81]  whatever the penalty is, get rid of it. Whatever you would get taxed, get rid of it. Then that final amount, 2.5%
[ 504.81 –  510.57]  of that theoretical amount. Let me give you a simple example. Suppose your four zero one k had 200,000,
[ 510.73 –  513.37]  in it, and you have a 20%,
[ 513.69 –  520.05]  penalty if you were to cash it out. So if you have a 20% penalty that makes it to 160,000.
[ 520.21 –  523.10]  Suppose your tax bracket is roughly 25%.
[ 523.41 –  524.62]  So $160,000
[ 524.62 –  526.70]  then goes to $120,000.
[ 526.86 –  529.59]  Okay? Now you calculate 2.5
[ 529.59 –  531.03]  of that $120,000
[ 531.03 –  533.27]  and that works out to $3,000.
[ 533.75 –  534.71]  $3,000.
[ 534.71 –  538.95]  That's ma'chu. That's reasonable. If your four zero one k is 300,000,
[ 539.11 –  540.23]  then $3,000
[ 540.23 –  542.98]  is Or sorry, 200,000, then $3,000

[1054.94 – 1056.14]  which is when you retire.
[1056.31 – 1058.14]  Right? Because they are in
[1058.68 – 1081.65]  the Hukum of long term, not the Hukum of short term. The ruling will be the long term. So four zero one k's, you do not pay zakat on until you get the actual cash. When will you get the cash? When you are 65, 71, you basically cash out your four zero one k, then you will give zakat on it. Until that time, it's really not And the reason they say this, it's not your full property. You don't have what's called You
[1082.29 – 1086.61]  don't have control. Other people, your company, others, there's liabilities.
[1086.69 – 1089.23]  You can't have a full say in it. So
[1089.47 – 1098.51]  bottom line, the strongest position four zero one k, InshaAllah ta'ala, there is no zakat until you actually cash out on it. Okay. So what is left then? What is left
[1098.91 – 1103.38]  is the things that you own and you use in your bank account. By unanimous
[1103.38 – 1104.34]  consensus,
[1104.58 – 1110.65]  the wealth that is not cash but you use it, for example, your house, your cars, your clothes,
[1110.89 – 1111.86]  your shoes,","The ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan is that you do not pay zakat on it until you have actual access to the cash. If there are penalties for accessing the funds, it indicates that you do not have full ownership of that amount. When you do eventually cash out your 401(k), you should calculate zakat based on the amount you would receive after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 with a 20% penalty and a 25% tax bracket, you would calculate zakat on the remaining amount after these deductions. Until you reach retirement age and can access the funds without penalties, zakat is not applicable.

[3059.64 – 3065.16]  across North America. And that we just calculated for you, you know, 1,800 is a $1,900
[3065.16 – 3070.14]  roughly, it could be less than this depending on the penalty and the taxes and that's fairly reasonable.
[3070.21 – 3072.78]  And you don't have to pay in one go. You can,
[3073.41 – 3080.21]  you know, take it out over a few months. So for example, when Ramadan comes, you calculate, let's say that your four zero one k has 2,500

[ 886.54 –  892.54]  are simply like a house that you have, you pay zakat on the dividends and not on the actual
[ 892.54 –  894.84]  amount. And short term investments,
[ 894.84 –  899.08]  you will treat them as business property, so you will give 2.5%
[ 899.08 –  902.03]  of that. As for four zero one k plans,
[ 902.12 –  929.80]  then this is something that I have done actually quite a lot of research in this one area because I was bombarded with questions. And I am now confident to say that inshaAllahu ta'ala, what seems to be the correct position, there is no zakat on 401 K, if you don't have unfettered access to it. I e, if there is a penalty for you to access your four 0 one K, then you don't technically have access to it. So it's not your full milk. It's not your full Milk in Arabic means ownership.

So today, InshaAllah, we're gonna go into a little bit of detail about whether zakat should be given and how much should be given and how do we calculate zakat on retirement funds.
[  54.51 –   64.83]  Before we begin, I need to point out that this is a topic dealing with Islamic finance. And as I have said many, many times, modern Islamic finance is actually a very

USER: what is the ruling on zakat on 401k?
ASSISTANT: The ruling on zakat for a 401(k) plan is that you do not pay zakat on it until you have actual access to the cash. If there are penalties for accessing the funds, it indicates that you do not have full ownership of that amount. When you do eventually cash out your 401(k), you should calculate zakat based on the amount you would receive after deducting any penalties and taxes. For example, if your 401(k) has $200,000 with a 20% penalty and a 25% tax bracket, you would calculate zakat on the remaining amount after these deductions. Until you reach retirement age and can access the funds without penalties, zakat is not applicable. 

In summary, zakat is not due on a 401(k) until you cash it out.

[2846.57 – 2866.47]  Giving zakat will bring about peace and will bring about blessings and will bring about Allah's barakah. There's no question that the opinion will be more blessed and your wealth will grow because our Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam gave a qasam, he swore by Allah that giving zakat does not diminish one's charity.
[2866.55 – 2875.09]  So the conclusion that I have is that the default, because the default is that retirement plans in America are optional and voluntary,
[2875.64 – 2883.32]  and you are choosing to get in, unlike in many Middle Eastern countries, because there's clear ownership, milkiyah, you clearly have milkiyah.
[2883.32 – 2891.63]  And because this is clearly a type of wealth that is meant to to generate more income, this is a point I didn't get into, it's called Al Malan Nami, which is that wealth
[2891.63 – 2905.69]  generating, it's not just stagnant wealth, you are generating money from it. And so when you're generating money, therefore zakat should be paid annually on the zakat liable amount, which is after taxes and penalty. And to taxes and penalty.
